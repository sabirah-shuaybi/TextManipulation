# TextManipulation

__TextPlay__ facilitates the manipulation of text through swing components such as:
a JSlider, a JComboBox, a JTextField, and a JButton.
 * The JSlider allows user to increase or decrease font size.
 * The JComboBox allows user to pick a font style from menu.
 * The JTextField is the field in which the user types the text they want displayed
 * The JButton allows user to remove the last text object created
The onMouseClick method intercepts mouse clicks and allows for creation of a text object
at the location of the user click.
